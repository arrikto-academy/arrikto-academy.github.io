# Lab: Create `split_data` Step

In the *Build Models* subsection of the *Modeling* section, we split data for
training and evaluation and then build and evaluate three regression models. In
this lab, weâ€™ll define a pipeline step for the data splitting portion of our
workflow.

## Requirements 

Annotate one or more cells in the *Build Models* section of our notebook to
meet the following requirements:

1. Annotate one or more cells in our notebook to create a pipeline step named
`split_data` that splits our dataset for use in later training and evaluation
steps.
2. Specify the correct dependency relationship for `split_data`.

## Solution

When you are finished, compare your notebook to the
[solution](lab-split_data-solution.md) and make any necessary changes so that
your notebook matches the solution.

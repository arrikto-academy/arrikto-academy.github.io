# Lab: Imports

Organize and annotate a second *Imports* cell in your copy of our notebook.
This cell should include all import statements currently included in cells
found in the *Modeling* section of our notebook.

## Requirements

Review all cells in the *Modeling* section of our notebook and make the
following changes:

- Create a cell just below the “Modeling” header.
- Move all the import statements below this point in the notebook into the
  new cell you’ve just created.
- Annotate the new cell you created as an *Imports* cell.

## Solution

When you are finished, compare your notebook to the 
[solution](lab-imports-solution.md) and make any
necessary changes so that your notebook matches the solution.

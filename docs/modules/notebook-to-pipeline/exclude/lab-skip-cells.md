# Lab: Skip Cells

Now, as a lab exercise, take a look at all the cells currently included in

not necessary for cleaning data will be skipped. Here’s what `clean_data`
looks like as you begin this exercise.

Once you’ve made the updates you believe are required, take a look at the
[solution](lab-skip-cells-solution.md) and verify that you’ve made the right changes.

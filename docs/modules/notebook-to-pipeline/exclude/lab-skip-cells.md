# Lab: Skip Cells

Now, as a lab exercise, take a look at all the cells currently included in
the `clean_data` step and update those cells to meet the requirements specified
below.

## Requirements

1. Update the cells in the *Clean Data* section of our notebook so that cells
not necessary for cleaning data will be excluded from the `clean_data` pipeline
step. Here’s what `clean_data` looks like as you begin this exercise.

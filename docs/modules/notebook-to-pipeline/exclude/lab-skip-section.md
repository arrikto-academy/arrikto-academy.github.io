# Lab: Skip Section

To keep the Visualize Data section in the notebook, but also have Kale ignore
it, we need to annotate all the cells in this section as *Skip Cells* just like
we did for the diagnostic cells in the two pipeline steps we’ve already
defined.

## Requirements

1. Update your copy of our notebook so that all cells in the Visualize Data
section of our notebook will be excluded from the Kubeflow pipeline we are
building.

## Solution

??? "Expand to see solution"

    - When you’re done, every cell in the Visualize Data section should be marked
      with the *Skip Cell* annotation. 
    - In total there should be six cells you’ll need to annotate as a Skip Cell.
